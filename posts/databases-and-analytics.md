A database is an organized collection of data, it can be used for storing, maintaining and accessing any sort of data.
There are two types of databases, **_relational_** and **_non-relational_** databases.

A **_relational_** database is a type of database that stores and provides access to data points that are related to one
another. It organizes data into rows and columns, which collectively form a table. Data is typically structured across
multiple tables, which can be joined together via a primary key or a foreign key. These unique identifiers demonstrate
the different relationships which exist between tables

A **_non-relational_** database stores data in a non-tabular form, and tends to be more flexible than the relational
database. There are no tables, rows, primary keys or foreign keys. Instead, the non-relational database uses a storage
model optimized for specific requirements of the type of data being stored.
